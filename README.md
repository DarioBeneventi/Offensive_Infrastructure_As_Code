# Automation of Offensive Security

 This repository is used to automate the infrastructure needed for Command and Control on a cloud provider. Use this in combination with bouncing servers to stay anonymous.

 This project is still in development, information and code will be added continuously.

 **Disclaimer - We use the AWS API to automate in this example so be aware that this service uses your personal credit card info so keep it ethical, you will be caught and you will pay the consequences in case of malicious intent.**
 
 Inspired by SparcFlow's book "Hack like a Ghost" - I highly recommend reading this book if you like what you see in this repository.
